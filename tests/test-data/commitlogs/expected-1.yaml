changelog_items:
  - A commit subject on a pretty long line so that it would overshoot limits
    continued here.
  - Some item which is also pretty verbose and contains a lot of detail so
    that it would be continued in the next line but it should still become
    one changelog item. And a %%macro.
  - Some
  - more
  - but
  - shorter
  - items
